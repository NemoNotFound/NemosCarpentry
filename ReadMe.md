# Nemo's Carpentry

Nemo's Carpentry brings the Carpenter's Workbench, which is used to craft chairs, tables, doors and more in the future!
If you need some recipes, check out the wiki!

I love to create mods for Minecraft, so I hope you like what I do.
Either way feel free to give me your feedback and suggestions, either in the comments or on my [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yxs9dga) :)

Have fun!

**Note:**
The Woodcutter is not part of Nemo's Carpentry anymore. 
So if you use version 2.0.0 or higher and still want to use the Woodcutter, check out Nemo's Woodcutter!
